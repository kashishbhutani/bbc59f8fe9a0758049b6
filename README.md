This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Postman API Documentation - 
  - You can find the postman documentation under docs/ directory
* Note - 
  - I was not able to perform the search endpoint i.e Typeahead as I am not that much familiar with Mongoid ORM, I have mainly worked on ActiveRecord but definately I can figure out how to achieve it in Mongoid.
